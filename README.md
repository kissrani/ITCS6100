# Communication plan
We plan to communicate 3 times per week through zoom or in-person meetings based on the availability of the group members. The meetings will last for 2-3 hrs each.

# Data Understanding
The Data we have was divided in 4 different files. The link of the data we used is https://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-latest-small.zip
The data is divided into links.csv, movies.csv, tags.csv and ratings.csv

We used the primary key Movie ID to merge these data files and form our data set. Our data
set consists of 100000 entries. The dataset merged_data.csv has all the data in it. Our data
has movieId,imdbId,tmdbId,title,genres,rating,userId,tag,timestamp,userId column names
respectively.

Now we do exploratory data Analysis on our dataset.
## Exploratory Data Analysis
We use AWS Quick sight for our exploratory data analysis.

The graph above is the pie chart for representing the movies by genres. Here we can see
that a large number of movies dont have one unique genre. But lie in the others category.
The others category here represents that a large proportion of movies has more than one
genre.

Here we see the graph of ratings vs tags. The artists who have the highest to lowest ratings
are given below. This gives us an idea of the peoples choice. We can see that in our data
Morgan Freeman has the highest number of ratings. This also gives us an idea that the
graph is skewed. Tags canâ€™t be considered as a feature in our model.

Here we plot the pie diagram to represent the number of ratings by genres. This is an
interesting plot which shows us that which genres united together gives the best combination
and has the highest rating. Our data says that the movies having genres like Comedy,
Criminal, Drama and Thriller are the highest rated movies among users. The movies with
Action genre precede these choices. The least preferred genre would be a combination of
Criminal, Mystery, Thriller and Adventure movies. These features give the recommendation
system a clear idea of what the preferences are in similar audience.

The most important relation of all is the title and ratings analysis. This graph shows us the
average ratings for a movie out of 5. The favourites and relevant favourites can be mapped
through this. Our main aim is to take the users input and based on the input give similar
movies that might be the users favourite or are rated similar by the other users.

Average of Ratings by Genre and Title this tells us the value of these 3 features in our
model. This clearly shows that our data is ready to undergo further process. Each movie can
be distinguished as to which movie belongs to which genre and what rating it scores in its
genre.

## Dashboard
The link to the dashboard is
https://us-east-1.quicksight.aws.amazon.com/sn/accounts/530834130991/dashboards/1b211
208-2faf-4afd-844a-6dc13bcfe64f?directory_alias=yawfrempong

Since it is a private instance. It cant be accessed by others.
The screenshot below will show how the dashboard in Quicksight Looks.

### Data Preparation
* Step 1 \
We use Sage maker for the data preparation process and data cleaning process. We take
Imports that are required for the process

* Step 2 \
We need to Create an S3 bucket where all our csv files will be stored. We write simple
python code to get the csv files. Convert them to dataframes and merge these data frames
to get the required data set.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78280206/164282497-44d0e403-9620-4d53-a249-6abf9bf1ff33.png) \
In this code we check if the region is us-east-1 so that our account location matches the S3
bucket location.

We get the file merged_data after merging the files we need for our analysis. Here MovieId
is the primary key for movies.csv and a foreign key in all other csvs.

* Step 3 \
Check our S3 folder has been created. This folder will have our S3 repository and all other
data. The folder now also has the newly merged data file.The recommendation-storage is
the bucket we need.

* Step 4 \
We can write a json code to take our data
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78280206/164282687-b8cd2ce4-06ea-4c50-961e-63c3c9e1e8fc.png)

* Step 5 \
Now we read the newly merged csv file to perform further cleaning of data according to our
needs.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78280206/164282744-13240e36-fdc8-4c61-a91a-373990bb7ac7.png)

* Step 6 \
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78280206/164282793-d4b895e5-caf9-4330-90d7-aab5faa1d418.png)

In this step, we define two variables in the dataset to filter out unliked movies and better
simulate data gathered by a video-on-demand (VOD) platform.

Since this is an explicit feedback movie rating dataset, it includes movies rated from 1 to 5. For
this tutorial, we want to include only moves that were "liked" by the users, and simulate a
implicit dataset that is similar to data that is gathered by a video-on-demain (VOD) platform. For
that, you will next filter out all interactions below 2 out of 5, and create two EVENT_TYPE
variables: click and watch. Any movies rated 2 and above are assigned as click, and any
movies rated 4 and above are assigned as click and watch.

This is the final step for our data cleaning. We get the data like we want from here.
Further, We will choose a ML algorithm to do further processes.
